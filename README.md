# ECC - Ensemble Classifier Chains

Welcome to the ECC GitHub repository! This project aims to improve the implementation of the Ensemble of Classifier Chains method for multi-label classification problems. Below, you'll find instructions on how to get started with ECC and an example of how to use it.

## Overview

ECC is a method that extends the Classifier Chains approach by incorporating an ensemble of base classifiers. This implementation leverages `scikit-learn` for the base model and provides additional functionalities for efficient training, prediction, and model evaluation.

## Installation

To start with `ECC` you must install the required packages. You can do this using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```


## Usage

Here is a step-by-step example of how to use ECC with a `RandomForestClassifier`:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import make_multilabel_classification
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from ECC import ECC

# 1. Generate a multi-label classification dataset (simulated)
X, Y = make_multilabel_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, 
                                      n_classes=5, n_labels=2, 
                                      random_state=42)
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, 
                                                    random_state=42)

# Convert Y_train and Y_test into DataFrame for ease of use
Y_train = pd.DataFrame(Y_train)
Y_test = pd.DataFrame(Y_test)

# 2. Initialize the ECC model with a RandomForestClassifier as the base model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
ecc = ECC(model=model, n_chains=10, n_jobs=1) 

# 3. Fit the ECC model
ecc.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# 4. Predict probabilities on the test set
probas = ecc.predict_proba(X_test)

# 5. Make binary predictions on the test set using a threshold of 0.5
binary_preds = ecc.predict(X_test, threshold=0.5)

# 6. Make binary predictions using the cardinality of the training set as threshold
cardinality_preds = ecc.predict_cardinality(X_test, Y_train)

# 7. Save predictions to CSV for later use
ecc.save_predictions(binary_preds, 'binary_predictions.csv')
ecc.save_predictions(probas, 'probability_predictions.csv')
ecc.save_predictions(cardinality_preds, 'cardinality_predictions.csv')

# 8. Get the execution time of each chain and the total training time
chain_times, total_time = ecc.get_chain_times()
print(f"\nExecution time of each chain: {chain_times}")
print(f"\nTotal training time: {total_time:.2f} seconds")

# 9. Check the size of the models for each chain in bytes
model_sizes = ecc.model_size()
print(f"Model sizes for each chain (in bytes): {model_sizes}")

# 10. Check the size of the models for each chain in bytes
model_sizes_2 = ecc.model_size_joblib()
print(f"Model sizes for each chain: {model_sizes_2}")

# 11. Display the first 5 binary predictions
print("First 5 binary predictions:")
print(binary_preds[:5])

# 12. Display the first 5 cardinality-based predictions
print("First 5 cardinality-based predictions:")
print(cardinality_preds[:5])

# 13. Display the first 5 predicted probabilities
print("First 5 predicted probabilities:")
print(probas[:5])
```
